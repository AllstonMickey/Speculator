# Speculator [![travis build](https://img.shields.io/travis/AllstonMickey/Speculator.svg?style=flat-square)](://travis-ci.org/AllstonMickey/Speculator)
This project aims to predict future stock prices using popular algorithms from machine learning and finance.

Currently, prices are being taken from Poloniex, a Bitcoin/cryptocurrency asset exchange.  Normal markets will also be added in future updates.

### Basis
Part of this project is focused on an implementation of the research paper ["Predicting the direction of stock market prices using random forest"](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1605.00003.pdf), by Luckyson Khaidem, Snehanshu Saha, and Sudeepa Roy Dey.
I hope to gain insights into the accuracy of market technical analysis combined with modern machine learning methods.
This tool should not be used as financial advice, but serve merely as offering a display of technical analysis which may offer another perspective on any investments.

### Getting Started
The project is not ready for use at this time.  Still in development.

### Testing Implementations
##### Running Unit Tests
```
cd $SPECULATOR_PATH/speculator/tests
python -m unittest discover
```
